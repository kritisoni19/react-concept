# react-concepts
I used to practice react daily for brushing up my skills


HOC

1. counter 1 and counter 2 same logic implement, so create a higher order comp
2. HigherOrder.js file write => inside the func write common logic 
3. import hoc in counter file, access the attribute using props annd wrap that component with hoc
